# Advent of Code 2021
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2021, delivered in my favourite format of a web API
for no particular reason other than me wanting to play around with Ktor.

All challenges are reachable on `GET http://localhost:8080/day/{day}/part/{part}`, the input
data is located in `src/main/resources`.

If you want to you can use `runner.sh` to run the commands, it's a lot easier than running it
through a browser or Postman.
